<h1>Object-Oriented Programming: Team Profile Generator</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of this challenge is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.</p>

<h2>User Story</h2>
<p>AS A manager, I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info, SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles.</p>

<h2>Acceptance Criteria</h2>
<li>GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input, WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information, THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input</li>
<li>WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML, THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
</li>
<li>WHEN I click on the GitHub username, THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
</li>
<li>WHEN I start the application, THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
</li>
<li>WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number, THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
</li>
<li>WHEN I select the engineer option, THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
</li>
<li>WHEN I select the intern option, THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
</li>
<li>WHEN I decide to finish building my team, THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated
</li>
